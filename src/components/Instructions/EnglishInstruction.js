                    The rules are very simple and probably you 
                    remember them from your childhood: <br></br>
                    If you choose Rock, you will win against Scissors but 
                    lose against Paper. <br></br>
                    If you choose Scissors, you will win against Paper but 
                    lose against Rock.  <br></br>
                    If you choose Paper, you will win against Rock but 
                    lose against Scissors. <br></br>
                    There can be 3 to 5 rounds. The game ends when 
                    somebody gets 3 wins. If you want to play again, just 
                    click “Play again” button after a game is finished.
